`The Cloud-Based Web Hosting Project is designed to demonstrate the deployment of a static website using a cloud-based server. 
This project provides hands-on experience in cloud computing, server management, and website deployment. By leveraging cloud services 
such as AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean, we illustrate the practical applications of virtual machines (VMs) 
and cloud-based infrastructure. The primary objective is to set up a virtual machine (VM), configure it with a Linux-based web server 
like Apache or Nginx, and deploy a static website. The website will serve as a personal portfolio or an informational page, 
including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements. Additionally, it will contain details on cloud service provider configurations, network 
settings, and security mechanisms, ensuring accessibility through a public IP address or a domain name.

The project consists of several key components. First, the virtual machine setup involves selecting a cloud service provider and 
launching an instance with an appropriate operating system, such as Ubuntu or CentOS. Next, a web server is installed and configured, 
ensuring proper hosting of the static website files. The networking and security configuration includes assigning a static IP, 
configuring firewall rules, and enabling SSH authentication for secure access. Finally, the website deployment phase involves 
uploading static files, testing accessibility, and setting up maintenance scripts for continuous performance.

Cloud computing provides numerous advantages over traditional hosting methods, including scalability, cost-efficiency, and higher 
uptime. This project enables students to gain practical skills in cloud service management, Linux server administration, website 
hosting, and cybersecurity measures. By successfully deploying a static website, learners can use this project as a foundation 
for future cloud-based applications, including dynamic websites, databases, cloud storage, and API hosting.`;
